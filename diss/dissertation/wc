In recent years, contactless smart-cards (also known as integrated circuit cards, or ICCs) have become extremely popular for a great number of applications. Perhaps one of the first major applications was by Transport for London, whereby contactless Oyster cards'' could be used in place of paper tickets for travel on buses and the underground railway system. As they've become more affordable and the development ecosystem has expanded, their use has become even more widespread. In the UK, contactless bank cards are commonplace, and the University of Cambridge distributes contactless university cards to students, which can be used to gain access to colleges/departments. Some colleges even allow students to pay for food and drink with these cards. -l
