Package release notes
---------------------

8.04
----
* (PLAID804.java) A bug in the RSA shillkey constructor has been corrected to more accurately emulate a modulus using random 
data. This is necessary as some modern cards partially validate the data before allowing the setting of a modulus value.

8.03
----
* (PLAID803.java) The Card Holder applet has been rewritten (while maintaining backwards compatibility). Enhancements 
include faster authentication, a smaller applet and lower RAM requirements.
* (PLAID803.java) Multiple bugs corrected relating to the operations provided by the "Reinitialise PLAID applet" and 
"Reset PLAID variables" buttons.

8.02
----
* (Plaid.exe/Plaid.java) Modified the AID of the selectable PLAID applet to match the value specified in AS-5185. 
The AID value used is A0 00 00 04 64.

* (Plaid.exe) The first keysetID priority can be set to a value of 0x7777 to represent a value which 
the card has no knowledge of. The GUI has been modified so this value is included in
the APDU sent to the user's ICC (previously sent 0x0000).

8.01
----
* (Plaid.exe) Correct bug in the C# GUI when selecting the protocol T=1 in the configuration tab.

8.00
----
* Initial release for AS-5815 compliant version.


Known limitations
-----------------
* Secure uploading of keys to the ICC is yet to be implemented.
